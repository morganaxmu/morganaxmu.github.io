# Education

In 2009, i became a student of Guangzhou 89th senior school, where I spent 6 years.
During 2015-2019, I was an undergraduate student from Xiamen University (for short XMU), China, where I major in chemistry and my sub-major is finance.

## About Me

I'm not a person prossessed too much talents, but I am full of curiousity. I'm interested in big data, behaviour economics, psychology and Chinese literature.

I've learnt the R language and Python by myself. I will put some code of R and Python on Github. Also I've operated a Wechat public account for several years.
